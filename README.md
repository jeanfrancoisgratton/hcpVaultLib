# hcpVaultLib
___

A Hashicorp Vault client package

This lib (package) was first written for my own use and was not even published on Github at first.
As I intend on expanding the package, now is a good time to publish and document the package.


## What's in there:

Mainly functions to:
- unseal a Vault
- login with a token
- login with the userpass method
- fetch a secret from a given secret engine
